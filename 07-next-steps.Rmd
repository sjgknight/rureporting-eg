# Proposed Directions

A set of recommendations are presented below, drawing on the evidence synthesised, analysis of other tools and platforms available, expert input and practitioner input.

These recommendations are intended to situate xâ€™s connection to the evidence base at present, possible gaps/misalignment with this evidence, and opportunities to align and contribute to the evidence base. 

## Assumptions

The literature has a number of potential implications for x development. However it is important to remember that any recommendations from literature are based on the specific aims and theories of change being evaluated and investigated in that literature. x adopts a different model to much of this literature, and therefore the recommendations are not directly transferable. 

We have tried to provide these recommendations in a fairly agnostic form, so they are not contingent on specific implementation (and prioritisation), which is largely the remit of x
