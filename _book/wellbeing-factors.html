<li>“What are the most important factors in [wellbeing]?”</li>

<p>Work was undertaken to align iyarn with evidence-based models of wellbeing, to identify the key <em>factors</em> that constitute wellbeing, and their relationship to the <em>segments</em> that users checkin on in the iyarn tool.</p>
<p>Three principles can underpin segment focus</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Conceptual: They should be relatable, identifiable, and distinct (ideally mutually exclusive), e.g. sport &amp; exercise overlap</li>
<li>Research: Supported by research as being important for young people, and aligned with the wider theoretical grounding of the iyarn tool</li>
<li>Practical: How often they’re currently used, with your existing secondary user base (build on what you have)</li>
</ol>
<p>Initial analysis indicated a top 8 most used segments, with some overlap with an existing iyarn wellbeing wheel:</p>

<p>In order to provide an evidence-based tool for supporting young people’s wellbeing, we need a clear understanding of what factors underpin wellbeing, and what models of change would support improvements in wellbeing.</p>

</h3>
<p>Based on this initial mapping, we analysed a set of wellbeing models linked to iyarns conceptual model, and used with young people, to identify key factors to map to iyarn segments for an evidence-informed wellbeing wheel as in <a href="wellbeing-factors.html#fig:wellbeing-factors-doc">6.1</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>In order to provide an evidence-based tool for supporting young people’s wellbeing, we need to understand (1) how we can design interventions that use the tool effectively in the wider system; and (2) that are grounded in evidence around maintaining and improving wellbeing; and (3) that builds on the wealth of existing resources.</p>
<p>This document does three things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gives an overview of some theories of change and motivation and their implications for design</li>
<li>It flags some design features for interventions and how these might be drawn on, and evaluated, in the tool (see also the xlsx)</li>
<li>It maps some existing resources for identifying needs and evaluating impact (see also the xlsx)</li>
</ol>

</h3>
<p>At a basic level, this model might be implemented into the existing email structure ( <a href="wellbeing-factors.html#fig:wellbeingemail">6.4</a> ) to present users with relevant resources based on their needs, using the structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn (informational resources)</li>
<li>Lift (intrinsic mood lifters, e.g. music and exercise)</li>
<li>Develop (skills development resources)</li>
<li>Plan (resources to plan/behavioural activation)</li>
<li>Reflect (reflection prompts)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example, the sample email below ( <a href="wellbeing-factors.html#fig:wellbeingemail">6.4</a> ) shows (right) a current email structure, with (left) a proposed template for structured emails, and (middle) an example of how this might be applied to the ‘learning’ segment.</em></p>
One proposal from the user interviews was to move the reflection questions higher in the order of resources, because these may provide useful prompts prior to students exploring (and perhaps ceasing to explore) the external resources.

<p><em>How can we map existing resources to a model for iyarn?</em></p>
<p>We have mapped a range of resources to the segments identified, intervention structure, and cohort needs as in <a href="wellbeing-factors.html#fig:wellbeingmapping">6.5</a>. We have developed a resource (xlsx) that maps resources from a range of sources including:</p>
<ul>
<li>ReachOut</li>
<li>‘reflection questions/prompts’ via APPLI and in other ‘5 ways’ resources, etc.</li>
<li>Other resources targeted at young people and their wellbeing</li>
</ul>
<p>The resource flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target group</li>
<li>Context of delivery (individual, whole group, individually in a class)</li>
<li>Purpose: Information, Lift, Activation, or Planning</li>
</ul>

<p>How can (1) needs of individual schools be identified; and (2) the impact of iyarn be evaluated, using validated measures?</p>
<p>A range of measures exists for understanding wellbeing factors, and their antecedents (or enablers/barriers) (for an excellent resource, see Bates &amp; Boren, n.d., in addition to our other resources.). It is not clear how widely these are used by schools to understand and monitor their needs, however recent systematic review of measures of social emotional and behavioural screening instruments indicates that ‘useability’ (i.e., how feasible it is for a stakeholder to use the tool to achieve the intended goal) is under-reported, with a focus on technical validity, likely limiting use of these measures in multitiered support systems (Brann et al., 2022).</p>
<p>We have begun to map some of these resources to specific wellbeing segments, and their subfactors as below.</p>
<p>These may be used to both evaluate where a school might focus support, or/and assess impact of iyarn (e.g. through pre/post testing).</p>

<p>Based on the research, two key stakeholder-oriented resources were created:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A classroom powerpoint resource, intended to introduce factors of wellbeing and the iyarn tool <a href="wellbeing-factors.html#fig:wellbeing-powerpoint">6.7</a>
</li>
<li>A teacher guide which provides an overview of the background to iyarn and its use in classes. <a href="wellbeing-factors.html#fig:wellbeing-teacher-pack">6.8</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These can be augmented with the resource mapping, both through integration into the tool e.g. via the emails, or/and through support for teachers to navigate the mapped resources to select resources and activities appropriate for their context.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the guidance given here is about general check-ins with the iyarn tool. Expert guidance should be sought/established processes followed for any specific needs. Specifically, any disclosures made (verbally or in the comments) should refer to existing guidance e.g. <a href="https://reporter.childstory.nsw.gov.au/s/" class="uri">https://reporter.childstory.nsw.gov.au/s/</a> and <a href="https://gdhr.wa.gov.au/guides/what-to-teach/dealing-with-disclosures" class="uri">https://gdhr.wa.gov.au/guides/what-to-teach/dealing-with-disclosures</a></p>
