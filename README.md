Demonstrates use of rureporting functions, and a very rough template for a report. Can be viewed https://sjgknight.github.io/rureporting-eg/index.html

This report was written as a wrapper site to compile a set of outputs, along with their rationale and the overarching narrative. It was written using a tool called bookdown, with the aim to make it easier to navigate the materials without getting lost (and to support export to other formats like PDF).

This dummy demonstates two key things:

    * The - very messy - rureporting package, primarily the function include_doc which will either iframe embed documents (pptx, docx, pdf - all converted to pdf); or merge docs into a single PDF; a function include_frag will take a docx and convert to markdown for inclusion in the html.
    * Show how the files were setup…it’s quite messy, but without playing more with LaTeX it broadly let me do the things I wanted to in terms of combining documents in a smarter way than Word allowed

Feel free to adapt bits (please credit me if it’s useful), obviously the colour scheme and branding are linked to my current institution and cannot be used.
